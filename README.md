"Let's Hack the Earth."

🌏 Vision
----------
Google turned the Earth into a searchable database. Then, they turned it into a visual map. Now, WE turn it into the ultimate playground.

The Earth is not just a collection of static data. Every street corner, every mountain pass, and every city block is a racing track waiting to be awakened.

⚡ Mission
----------
This is not just a game proposal. This is a Movement. We are here to hack the world’s largest digital twin and redefine the meaning of "open world."

- No Fixed Tracks: The entire planet is your circuit.
- Geographic IQ: Your knowledge of the real world is your greatest weapon.
- Physical Realism: Real terrain, real weather, real physics.

🛠 Project Roadmap (The Hack Plan)
---------------------------------
1. Visionary Phase — Release the concept and manifesto (Current).
2. Viral Phase — Unleash AI-generated concept trailers to spark global hype.
3. Recruitment Phase — Gather the world's best hackers, PMs, and creators.
4. Development Phase — Prototype core mechanics, map ingestion, and physics.
5. Launch Phase — Public alpha, community-built tracks and mod tools.

The Goal: Wake the Giant. Show Google that the Earth is ready to be played.

Features (Initial Ideas)
------------------------
- Global track generation from real map data
- Procedural track modifiers based on weather and time-of-day
- Realistic vehicle physics tuned for varied terrains
- Social features: ghost runs, leaderboards, and community events
- Tools for creators: custom track editing and sharing

Contributing
------------
We welcome hackers, artists, designers, and storytellers.

- Open an issue to propose features or discuss ideas.
- Fork, implement a focused improvement, then open a pull request.
- When contributing, include tests and a short description of changes.

Legal & Ethics (Important)
--------------------------
- This project references real-world map data and service names. Do NOT imply endorsement, sponsorship, or affiliation with Google or any map provider.
- Respect terms-of-service and copyright of any map data you use.
- Consider privacy and safety when designing features that use real locations (do not encourage trespass or unsafe behavior).

## 🌏 Join the Movement: Wanted List

GER is not a company. It is a high-speed hack of reality. We are seeking "Visionary Vandals" to fill the following roles:

### **1. AI Movie Creators / Visual Hackers**

* **Mission:** Visualize the "Singularity" where Google Earth mutates into a racing circuit.
* **Objective:** Produce a 60-second concept trailer that makes the world (and Google) lose its mind.
* **Freedom:** Tool-agnostic. Use Runway, Pika, Sora, or Unreal Engine. If it looks like a "World-Scale Hack," it’s in.

### **2. Community Architect / Transitional PM**

* **Mission:** Design the "Self-Operating System" of this movement.
* **Objective:** Bridge the gap between human creativity and AI-driven coordination.
* **Strategy:** You are the "Human Hub." You don't just manage people; you architect the workflows that AI will eventually inherit. You are building the governance for an autonomous movement.

### **3. Sound Designers / Composers**

* **Mission:** Score the sound of "System Infiltration."
* **Objective:** Create the auditory experience—from the glitchy hum of data ingestion to the high-octane beats of a global race.
* **Freedom:** Mix digital noise with cinematic energy. Make us feel the speed of data.

Inspired by the idea of turning the planet into a creative, shared playground. This manifesto is a starting point — we'll refine the technical, legal, and community aspects together.
