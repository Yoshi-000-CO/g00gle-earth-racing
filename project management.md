**2. Community Architect / Transitional PM**

**Mission:**
GER does not need a "Project Manager." It needs "Project Management Functions."
Whether these functions are performed by humans, AIs, or a hybrid is irrelevant.

**The Strategy:**
Your role is to design the governance of this community—operating on the core assumption that **most coordination will eventually be fully AI-driven.**

In this early phase, you are the "Human Hub." You will connect the talent, pressure-test the workflows, and build the very system that AI will eventually inherit. You are not a manager; you are the architect of an autonomous movement.
