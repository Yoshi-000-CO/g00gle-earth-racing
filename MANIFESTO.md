# 🌏 PROJECT: G00gle Earth Racing (GER) Manifesto
**"The Earth is our playground. Let's Hack the Reality."**

## ⚡ THE VISION
Google Earth turned the planet into a searchable database. We are turning it into the ultimate racing circuit. This isn't just a game; it's a **Digital Infiltration** of the world's largest digital twin.

## 🛠 WHY WE HACK
1. **From Viewing to Experiencing**: Static maps are dead. We demand a living, breathable world where every street corner is a potential drift.
2. **Geographic Intelligence (Geo-IQ)**: Your local knowledge—the shortcuts, the back alleys, the hidden trails—is your greatest weapon.
3. **Waking the Giant**: We are building this to show Google that their data is screaming to be played.
